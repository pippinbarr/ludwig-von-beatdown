# Ludwig Von Beatdown

## Warning: Flash

This game was exported in Flash and, as you probably know, Flash has been discontinued. As such, I can only provide access to the source code and the `.swf` file at the moment.

If you happen to have an ancient computer that still runs Flash in the browser, or a copy of the Adobe Flash Standalone Player, you should be able to run the game.

At some point I may port the game to JavaScript or similar, and it's possible that the [ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) Flash emulator will get to a point where this game will run again. Let's see.

## Description
Ludwig Von Beatdown was written in ActionScript 3 using Adobe&#8217;s FlashBuilder 4.6 and the excellent [Flixel](http://www.flixel.org/) library. Sound effects were made in [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/) and the font is [Commodore 64 Pixelized](http://www.dafont.com/commodore-64-pixelized.font) by [Devin Cook](http://www.devincook.com/). Just between you and me, some inspiration was drawn from the game [Johann Sebastian Joust](http://jsjoust.com/) by [Die Gute Fabrik](http://www.gutefabrik.com/).
